You gain a Barbarian Path of your choice. A Path is a specialization that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your Path’s features that are of your Barbarian level or lower.
# Fundamental Paths
---
### [[Path of the Beast]]
_Selina as Helga_
### [[Path of the Berserker]]

### [[Path of the Storm Herald]]
_Fahmi as Zink_
### Zealot
### Divine Fury

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can channel divine fury into your weapon strikes. While you're raging, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with a weapon attack takes extra damage equal to 1d6 + half your Barbarian level. The extra damage is necrotic or radiant; you choose the type of damage when you gain this feature.

### Warrior of the Gods

At 3rd level, your soul is marked for endless battle. If a spell, such as [Raise Dead](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:raise-dead), has the sole effect of restoring you to life (but not undeath), the caster doesn't need material components to cast the spell on you.

### Fanatical Focus

Starting at 6th level, the divine power that fuels your rage can protect you. If you fail a saving throw while raging, you can reroll it, and you must use the new roll. You can use this ability only once per rage.

### Zealous Presence

At 10th level, you learn to channel divine power to inspire zealotry in others. As a bonus action, you unleash a battle cry infused with divine energy. Up to ten other creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you that can hear you gain advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn. (Something Something Temp Hp)

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.
