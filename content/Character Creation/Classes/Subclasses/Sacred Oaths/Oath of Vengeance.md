## Tenets

**Fight the Greater Evil**
Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil, I choose the greater evil.

**No Mercy for the Wicked**
Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.

**By Any Means Necessary** 
My qualms can't get in the way of exterminating my foes.

**Restitution** 
If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.
