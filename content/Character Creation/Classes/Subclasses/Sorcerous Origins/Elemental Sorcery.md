When your spellcasting feature lets you learn a Sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can select one of these spells in place of a spell from the standard Sorcerer spell list. 

You must otherwise obey all other restrictions in choosing a spell, and the spell becomes a Sorcerer spell for you.

**1st Level: Stone’s Durability**

Your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

As an action, you can gain a base AC of 13 + your Con modifier if you aren’t wearing armor. This lasts until you end it as a bonus action, you are incapacitated, or you don armor other than a shield.

**6th Level: Stone Aegis**

As a bonus action, you can grant a bonus to an allied creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage the target takes is reduced by 2 + your Sorcerer level divided by 4. This lasts for 1 minute, until you use it again, or until you are incapacitated.

Additionally, when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you hits the selected ally with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of the attacker. 

You can then make a melee weapon attack against the attacker. If it hits, you deal an extra 1d10 force damage, which is increased by 1d10 at 11th level and 17th level. You can only use the teleportation ability if you are on the same surface as the attacker.

**14th Level: Stone’s Edge**

When you cast a damage-dealing spell, choose one creature damaged by it. That creature takes extra force damage equal to half of your Sorcerer level. This feature can only be used once per casting of a spell.

**18th Level: Earth Master’s Aegis**

You can choose three allies to protect with Stone Aegis.
