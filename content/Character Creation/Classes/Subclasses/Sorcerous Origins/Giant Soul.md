## Giant Ancestor
You have to choose one of the following Giants as an Ancestor. They will grant you different benefits.

**Hill Giants**
Your ancestors are the Hill Giants, giants inhabiting the lowest rank in The Ordning. They are renowned for their stupidity, selfishness and gluttonous appetites. They are looked down on by other giants, and treated as savages.

**Fire Giants**
Your ancestors are the Fire Giants. These mater craftsmen are known for their love of metal, and their inability to collect it. As such they often take slaves to use as miners. Their place in the Ordning is one that comes with respect, if not authority.

**Frost Giants**
Your ancestors are the Frost Giants, who value strength above all. These giants occupy the second lowest rank in The Ordning, and dominate the snowy tundras as brutish scavengers. These Giants served as berserkers ~~in the elemental war against dragonkind, and to this day frequently hunt white or silver dragons for sport.~~

# SAVE THIS FOR LATER
14th Rage of Fallen Ostoria 18th Blessing of the All Father Rage of Fallen Ostoria Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability to channel the souls of your ancestors into your physical form. When you start casting a sorcerer spell on your turn and expend sorcery points or a spell slot, you can increase your size by one category – from Medium to Large, for example. This increase lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you die or are incapacitated. Until it ends, you gain the following benefits: Your current hit points and your hit point maximum both increase by 1 per sorcerer level. Your reach and the range of your cantrips both increase by 5 feet. Your walking speed increases by 5 feet. You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. You gain a bonus to the damage rolls of your melee weapon attacks; the bonus equals your Constitution modifier (minimum of +1). Your strength score matches your charisma score, if it is not already higher. Your melee weapon attacks gain the siege property. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Blessing of the All Father At 18th level, your Constitution score increases by 2, up to a maximum of 22. In addition, you can now use Rage of Fallen Ostoria twice between rests, but no more than once on a turn. If you use that feature while under its effects, its increases to your size, hit points, reach, and walking speed are cumulative.
