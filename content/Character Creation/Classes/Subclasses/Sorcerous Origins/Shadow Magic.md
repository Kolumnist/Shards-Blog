You are a creature of shadow, for your innate magic comes from the Soul Realm itself. You might trace your lineage to an entity from that place, or perhaps you were exposed to its fell energy and transformed by it.

The power of shadow magic casts a strange pall over your physical presence. The spark of life that sustains you is muffled, as if it struggles to remain viable against the dark energy that imbues your soul. At your option, you can pick from or roll on the Shadow Sorcerer Quirks table to create a quirk for your character.

| 1     | You are always icy cold to the touch.                                                         |
| 2     | When you are asleep, you don't appear to breathe (though you must still breathe to survive).  |
| 3     | You barely bleed, even when badly injured.                                                    |
| 4<br> | Your heart beats once per minute. This event sometimes surprises you.                         |
| 5<br> | You have trouble remembering that living creatures and corpses should be treated differently. |
| 6     | You blinked. Once. Last week.                                                                 |
