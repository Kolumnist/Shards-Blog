### Grasp of the Deep

As a Magic Action you can summon a 10-foot-long spectral tentacle (hp 10, ac 10, immunity to any damage but some special magic) at a point that you can see within 60 feet of you. The tentacle lasts for 1 minute.

As a Bonus Action you can move the tentacle up to 30 feet and you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 cold or lightning damage (your choice) and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

You can summon the tentacle a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest or half your uses (rounded down) through the Magical Cunning Feature.
### Gift of the Deep

You gain a swimming speed of 40 feet, you can breathe underwater and you have darkvision while you are deep underground or underwater.

### Fathomless Soul

You are immune against the effects of lesser curses that you know of. Additionally you gain resistance to cold damage. 
### Guardian Coil

When you or a creature you can see takes damage while within 10 feet of the tentacle, you can use your reaction to choose one of those creatures and reduce the damage to the chosen creature by 1d8 plus your charisma modifier. After doing so, the tentacle vanishes unless the damage was reduced to 0.

## Warlock Level 10

### Devouring Maw

As an action, choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you. For 1 minute, a translucent maw manifests in a 15-foot radius centered on that point. Each creature in that area when the maw appears must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be restrained. Any creature that starts its turn in the maw's area takes 3d6 cold or lightning damage (your choice). 

As an action, a restrained creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the restraint on a success. At the start of your turn, if there is a creature in the maw's area, you gain temporary hit points equal to your warlock level.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
### Thicker Tentacle

Your tentacle deals damage and protects for an additional 1d8.

## Warlock Level 14

### Unleash the Depths

_14th-level Lurker in the Deep feature_

Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability to call upon your patron for aid. As an action, you choose a point within 30 feet of you where your patron tears through reality, manifesting a measure of its thalassic grandeur. Choose one of the following effects to issue from this manifestation point. Once you use either effect, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

**_Transport._** You and up to five willing creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the manifestation point are grasped by spectral tentacles and yanked through your patron's realm. The tentacles teleport you and the chosen creatures to a point of your choice within 100 miles that you have visited within the past 24 hours. The tentacles then vanish.

**_Fury._** You can direct a barrage of spectral tentacles to issue forth and strike up to five creatures you can see within 30 feet of the manifestation point. Each target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 cold or lightning damage (your choice) and is knocked prone. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone. The tentacles then vanish.
### Level 14: Fathomless PlungeTCE p72[–]

_14th-level Fathomless feature_

You can magically open temporary conduits to watery destinations. As an action, you can teleport yourself and up to five other willing creatures that you can see within 30 feet of you. Amid a whirl of tentacles, you all vanish and then reappear up to 1 mile away in a body of water you've seen (pond size or larger) or within 30 feet of it, each of you appearing in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the others.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
