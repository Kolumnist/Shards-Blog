As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and balance combat, if one of the following conditions are met:

- You are hurt and no enemy in 30 feet of you is hurt.
- There is no capacitated ally and at least more than one enemy in 30 feet of you.

Each Creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its save, it has the Frightened and Incapacitated conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries to move as far from you as it can on its turns. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn’t have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. This effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if you die.

_Celestials, Constructs, Dragons and Fey are immune to all effects caused by this action._
