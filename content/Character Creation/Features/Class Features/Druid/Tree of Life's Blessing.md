Each day the Tree of Life will bestow on you one leveled spell that you may cast once this day, it doesn't cost you any spell slots and doesn't count against your prepared spells.
*The spell is randomly rolled but cannot be a spell you already have prepared.*

You also get healed from any illness and deep wounds on each long rest, as long as you are in an area the tree of life has its roots.
