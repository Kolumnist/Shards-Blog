You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action, except the Magic action.

Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

Starting at level 17, you can use it twice before a rest but only once on a turn.
