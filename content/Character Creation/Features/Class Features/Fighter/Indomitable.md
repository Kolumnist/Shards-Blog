If you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it with a bonus equal to your Fighter level. You must use the new roll, and you canâ€™t use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest.

You can use this feature twice before a Long Rest starting at level 13 and three times before a Long Rest starting at level 17.
