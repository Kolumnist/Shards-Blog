class: "[[Ranger]]"
---
A ranger with this ability learns to focus their awareness through the interconnections of nature. As a result, they learn additional spells upon reaching certain levels in the ranger class.

| Ranger Level | Spell              |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| 3rd          | Speak With Animals |
| 5th          | Beast Sense        |
| 9th          | Speak With Plants  |
Primal Awareness spells don’t count against the number of ranger spells a character knows. 

A ranger can cast each of these spells once without expending a spell slot. Once cast in this way, a ranger can’t cast these spells again before finishing a long rest.

Because these spells also count as ranger spells, you can also cast them using your ranger spell slots if you have them available.
