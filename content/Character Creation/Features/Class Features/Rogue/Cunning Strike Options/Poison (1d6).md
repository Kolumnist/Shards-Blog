class: "[[Rogue]]"

You add a toxin to your strike, forcing the target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Poisoned condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the Poisoned target repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

To use this effect, you must have a Poisoners Kit on your person and be proficient with it.
