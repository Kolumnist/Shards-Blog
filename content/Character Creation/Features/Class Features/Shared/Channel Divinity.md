You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes to fuel magical effects.

**[[Cleric]]** starts with two such effects: [[Divine Spark]] and [[Weighing Scales]].
**[[Paladin]]** starts with one such effect: [[Divine Sense]].
*You gain additional effect options at higher levels.*

You can use this classâ€™s Channel Divinity twice, you gain an additional use on:

- Cleric level 6(3) and level 18(4).
- Paladin level 11(3)

You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. 

If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from your Spellcasting.
