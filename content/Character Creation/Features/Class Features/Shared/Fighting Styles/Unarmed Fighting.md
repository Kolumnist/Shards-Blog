Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you arenâ€™t wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d4 becomes a d6.

At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.
