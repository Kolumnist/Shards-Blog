_Cost: 1 Sorcery Point_

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one), and you must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if youâ€™ve already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.
