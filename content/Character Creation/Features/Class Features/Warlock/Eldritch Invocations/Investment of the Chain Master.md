When you cast Find Familiar, you infuse the summoned familiar with a measure of your eldritch power, granting the creature the following benefits.

**_Aerial or Aquatic._** The familiar gains either a Fly Speed or a Swim Speed (your choice) of 40 feet.

**_Quick Attack._** As a Bonus Action, you can command the familiar to take the Attack action.

**_Necrotic or Radiant Damage._** Whenever the familiar deals Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage, you can make it deal Necrotic or Radiant damage instead.

**_Your Save DC._** If the familiar forces a creature to make a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC.

**_Resistance._** When the familiar takes damage, you can take a Reaction to grant it Resistance against that damage.
