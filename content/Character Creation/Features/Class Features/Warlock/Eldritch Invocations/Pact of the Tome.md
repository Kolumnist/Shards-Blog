Stitching together strands of shadow, you conjure forth a book in your hand at the end of a Short or Long Rest. This _Book of Shadows_ (you determine its appearance) contains eldritch magic that only you can access, granting you the benefits below. The book disappears if you conjure another book with this feature or if you die.

**_Cantrips and Rituals._** When the book appears, choose three cantrips, and choose two level 1 spells that have the Ritual tag. The spells can be from any class’s spell list, and they must be spells you don’t already have prepared. While the book is on your person, you have the chosen spells prepared, and they function as Warlock spells for you.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use the book as a Spellcasting Focus.
