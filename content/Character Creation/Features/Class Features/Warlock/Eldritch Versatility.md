class: "[[Warlock]]"
---
Whenever you reach a level in this class or spend at least two full days, you can do one of the following, representing a change of focus in your occult studies:

- Replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Pact Magic feature with another cantrip from theÂ warlock spell list.
- Replace any amount of ritual spells with an equal amount of ritual spells from your spell list.
- If you're 12th level or higher, replace one spell from your Mystic Arcanum feature with another warlock spell of the same level.

If this change makes you ineligible for any of your Eldritch Invocations, you must also replace them now, choosing invocations for which you qualify.
