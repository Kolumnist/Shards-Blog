Choose any spell from your class's spell list, it cannot be higher than your highest spell level. The spell you choose is added to a separate list. It can be cast once per long rest, is always prepared and doesn't need a spell slot to cast but can't be upcasted.

*The regular spell list and this "once per long rest list" are treated separately and do not interfere with each other in any way*
