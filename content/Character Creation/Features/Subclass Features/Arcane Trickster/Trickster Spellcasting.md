**Cantrips**
You know three cantrips: Mage Hand and two other cantrips of your choice from the Wizard spell list (see that class's section for its list). Mind Sliver and Minor Illusion are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one of your cantrips, except Mage Hand, with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Rogue level 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice.

**Spell Slots**
The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of 1st+ Level**
You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose three level 1 Wizard spells. Charm Person, Disguise Self, and Fog Cloud are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 7 Rogue, your list of prepared spells can include five Wizard spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells**
Whenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Wizard spell for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability**
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.

**Spellcasting Focus**
You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.
