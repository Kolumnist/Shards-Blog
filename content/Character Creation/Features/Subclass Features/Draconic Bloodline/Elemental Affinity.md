Your draconic magic has an affinity with a damage type associated with dragons. Choose one of those types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison.

You can spend 1 sorcery point to gain Resistance to that damage type for 1 hour. Additionally when you cast a spell that deals damage of that type, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell.
