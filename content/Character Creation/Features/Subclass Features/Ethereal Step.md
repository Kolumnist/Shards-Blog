At 7th level, you learn to step through the Ethereal Plane. As a bonus action, you can cast the [etherealness](https://5e.tools/spells.html#etherealness_phb) spell with this feature, without expending a spell slot, but the spell ends at the end of the current turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
