When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the specific Giant Ancestor Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

You can cast the spell Enlarge/Reduce by spending 2 sorcery points. If you cast it using sorcery points, you can only target yourself with it, and can only choose the enlarge option. When you cast it this way and you are not wearing any armor, then you do not require Concentration on the spell and for the duration your strength score matches your charisma score, if it is not already higher.
