When you cast Summon Aberration, you can modify it so that it doesn't require Concentration. If you do so, the spell's duration becomes 1 minute for that casting, and when summoned, the Aberration has a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Warlock level plus your Charisma modifier.

In addition, the first time each turn the Aberration hits a creature under the effect of your Hex, the Aberration deals extra Psychic damage to the target equal to the bonus damage of that spell.
