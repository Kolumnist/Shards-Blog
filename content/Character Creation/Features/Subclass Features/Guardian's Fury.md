_6th-level Path of the Warden feature_  
Your instincts allow you to combine your primal magic with strikes. When you take the Attack action while Raging, you can cast a Warden cantrip in place of one of your attacks.

Moreover, you can use Reckless Attack when you cast a Warden spell that requires a spell attack roll.
