As an Action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with Shadow energy, using your Channel Divinity. 

For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also consumes all non magical ight in a 20-foot radius making it dark around you and dim 20ft beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.

You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.
