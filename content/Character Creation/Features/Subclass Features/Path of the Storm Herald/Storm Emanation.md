While raging you create a stormy and magical Emanation extending 10 feet. Your Emanation has an effect that activates when you enter your rage, and you can activate the effect again on each of your turns as a Bonus Action.

Choose Desert, Sea, or Tundra. The effect depends on that chosen environment, as detailed below. You can change your choice whenever you gain a Barbarian level.

If the effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

**Desert**
All other creatures in your Emanation take 2 fire damage each. 

The damage increases to 3 at Barbarian level 5 and to 4 at Barbarian level 10.

**Sea**
Choose one other creature you can see in your aura. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save it takes 1d6 lightning damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

The damage increases to 2d6 at Barbarian level 10.

**Tundra**
Each creature of your choice in your Emanation gains 2 Temporary Hit points.

The temporary hit points increases to 3 at Barbarian level 5 and to 4 at Barbarian level 10.
