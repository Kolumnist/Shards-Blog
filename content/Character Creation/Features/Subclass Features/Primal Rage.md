_3rd-level Path of the Warden feature_  
You have learned to draw on primal magic, even in your Rage. You can cast Warden spells while you're Raging, but you have disadvantage on any Constitution saving throws you make to maintain concentration on your Warden spells.

Also, casting a spell of 1st-level or higher allows your Rage to continue, even if you don't meet the other requirements.
