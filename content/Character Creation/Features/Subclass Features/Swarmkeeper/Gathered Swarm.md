A swarm of intangible nature spirits has bonded itself to you and can assist you in battle. While youâ€™re alive, the swarm remains in your space, crawling on you or flying and skittering around you within your space. You determine its creature type, or the DM.

Once on each of your turns, you can cause the swarm to assist you in one of the following ways, immediately after you hit a creature with an attack:
- The attack's target takes 1d6 piercing damage and suffer from the swarms effect, if the target is not inside the range it only takes 1 + effect.
- The attack's target must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be moved by the swarm up to 20 feet horizontally in a direction of your choice. This effect only works if in range.
- You are moved by the swarm 5 feet horizontally in a direction of your choice.
