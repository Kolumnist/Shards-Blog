Starting at 18th level, you can spend 6 sorcery points as a bonus action to magically transform yourself into a shadowy form. In this form, you have resistance to all damage except force and radiant damage, and you can move through other creatures and objects as if they were [difficult terrain](https://5e.tools/quickreference.html#bookref-quick,3,difficult%20terrain). You take 5 force damage if you end your turn inside an object.

You remain in this form for 1 minute. It ends early if you are [incapacitated](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#incapacitated_phb), if you die, or if you dismiss it as a bonus action.
