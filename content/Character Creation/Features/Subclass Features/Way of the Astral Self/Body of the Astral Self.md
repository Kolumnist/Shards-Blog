When you have both your astral arms and visage summoned, you can cause the body of your astral self to appear (no action required). This spectral body covers your physical form like a suit of armor, connecting with the arms and visage. You determine its appearance.

While the spectral body is present, you gain the following benefits:

**Deflect Energy** 
When you take acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your [[Deflect Attacks]] to deflect it.

**Empowered Arms** 
You always add your Wisdom modifier to attacks and damage of your hands and checks. Once on each of your turns when you hit a target with the Arms of the Astral Self, you can deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die.
