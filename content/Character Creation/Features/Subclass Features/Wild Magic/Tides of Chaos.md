You can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain a +5 on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.

After you cause a Wild Magic Surge event, you may roll a d10 on a 5 or lower you regain the use of this feature.
