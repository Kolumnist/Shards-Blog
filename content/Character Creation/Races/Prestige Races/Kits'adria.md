##### Ability Score Increase
Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and one other stat increases as described by your subrace.
##### Age
Kits'adria reach maturity around the age of 17, at which point their aging process begins to slow and all but outright halts for the remainder of their life. They remain as foxes until they are roughly 11-13 years old, when their kitscratch forms, after which point their true humanoid forms are imagined into being. They can live up to 250-300 years, retaining their spry and youthful forms throughout their entire life.
##### Alignment 
Kits'adria are chaotic by nature but have been known to be neutral. They are often good-aligned and rarely vindictive enough to be evil, but an evil Kits’adria is not outside the realm of possibility. Neither is a lawful Kits'adria, however unlikely.
##### Darkvision
You can see in darkness up to 60 feet as if it were dim light, and dim light in that range as if it were bright light. When seeing in darkness, you see different colors in pastel shades, with red and green hues blending into shades of grey.
##### Impersonation
You always have the spell disguise self prepared. You may cast it once per long rest at will, requiring no spell slots or components (using Charisma as your spellcasting ability).
##### Kits'adrian Shapeshifting
You can shapeshift into the form of a small fox or back into your true form as a bonus action. When in fox form you have advantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws, but your Strength and Constitution scores are treated as 10 (unless they were lower) - this does not affect your maximum hit points, and your wounds are consistent between both forms. While in fox form you cannot perform verbal or somatic components, and any illusion magic that changes your appearance with your consent is suppressed when you are in fox form. When you become a fox you can choose if your equipment drops harmlessly around you or merges into your new form. Items that merge with you cannot be reached or used until you transform back. As a fox, you can still wield melee weapons with the light or finesse property by holding them in your mouth. While transformed you must roll a Constitution saving throw every time you take damage as if you were concentrating on the effect. On a failure, you turn back into your true form and cannot change shape this way again until you complete a short or long rest. If you are reduced to 0 hit points you revert to your true form.
##### Languages
Kits'adria can speak their fox form language (Kitzish) which has no written equivalent. This can be spoken in their fox form or true form. Additionally, they can speak either Common or Elvish, and one other language of their choice is taken from a community they developed in.
##### Size
Your size is small or medium (you choose when creating your character). Kits’adria can range in height from the size of Halflings to having more Elven body types, though they are always cunning and graceful.
##### Speed
Your base land speed is 30 feet.

##### Ability Score Increase
Your Charisma score increases by 1
##### Escape Expert
When you move out of another creature’s attack range and provoke an opportunity attack, you can use your reaction to take the Disengage action. You must choose to do so before the opportunity attack is made, and the attacker’s reaction is not expended when you do so. 
##### Unflinching Heel
When crossing difficult terrain that does not involve any movement speed except walking, climbing, or burrowing, you ignore any penalty to movement it might cause. Furthermore, when in your fox form, you have a burrow speed equal to half your base movement speed (rounded down).
